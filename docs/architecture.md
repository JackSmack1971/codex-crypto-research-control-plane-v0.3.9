# Architecture

The system separates probabilistic research interpretation from deterministic state/data machinery.

## Owning planes

**DEFINITION / behavioral policy** — `AGENTS.md`, `.codex/agents/*.toml`, `.agents/skills/**`.

**POLICY / authority** — Codex sandbox, approval policy, MCP/app permissions, network policy, host-managed OAuth, and user authorization. Repository instructions do not grant those permissions.

**EXTERNAL ACQUISITION** — configured Massive MCP server for endpoint discovery, authenticated retrieval, pagination, transient workspace staging, and SQL/query operations. Provider-facing `call_api` starts are admitted by a deterministic request gate before the tool call and recorded in an attempt-scoped ledger.

**DURABLE DATA PLANE** — repository-owned canonical JSONL materialization, row-count/key verification, SHA-256 binding, point-in-time/cutoff enforcement, and immutable acquisition manifests.

**DETERMINISTIC RESEARCH PIPELINE** — feature store, market state, cross-sectional factor ranks, BTC/ETH/market residual model, macro coverage, ensemble, research-only risk sizing, forecast payload, and frozen forecast ledger.

**ORCHESTRATION / REVIEW** — primary Codex research-director plus named independent analytical/review roles.

## Capability model

Every external capability has three facts: discovery, dated snapshot status, and actual authenticated access. `config/daily-capabilities.json` assigns severity:

- CORE: required to produce a daily crypto forecast;
- ENRICHMENT: broadens cross-asset context; denial yields explicit DEGRADED coverage;
- EVENT_OPTIONAL: event-driven intelligence, skipped when unavailable unless an active registered design requires it.

This avoids treating provider/account entitlement mismatch as either permission to bypass or an unnecessary kill switch for otherwise valid core research.

```

On Windows, bare `python` is never the bootstrap authority: native PowerShell resolves and binds an executable runtime first. A transient Massive workspace is never the governed data record. Agent prose is never the deterministic calculation authority. A provider-rate rule that must hold is enforced by the request gate and rechecked before forecast freeze; prompt-level pacing judgment is not sufficient evidence.

## Two-phase crypto core

The first MCP phase fixes the PIT universe and cutoff-day cross-section. Deterministic code then selects the configured liquid USD universe. The second phase retrieves the historical lookback only for that fixed eligible set plus BTC/ETH anchors. This keeps the daily acquisition bounded while preserving a proper historical feature/residual model.

## Attempt lineage

`run_id` identifies the stable research date; every retry receives a new `attempt_id`. Prior terminal artifacts are never overwritten. Release packages intentionally ship no date-specific runtime research artifacts.

```

No agent recommendation or MCP result is itself a state transition.


## Windows runtime bootstrap hardening

On Windows, provider acquisition is downstream of a Python-independent PowerShell bootstrap. Repository paths resolve from the active project root, never the installed Skill directory. The resolver records every candidate outcome, checks repo virtualenv/Windows registry/common installs/uv/PATH, rebinds launchers to the actual interpreter executable, and may provision only a repository-local CPython under `.runtime/python` via uv. No system PATH mutation or global Python installation is permitted. Massive calls remain forbidden until Python >=3.11 executes successfully and the runtime descriptor is persisted. The stable daily run identity is derived from the completed UTC research date, not from the wall-clock execution date; bootstrap owns this default resolution.


### Windows structured-argument boundary (v0.3.7)
All structured provider and materialization metadata is file-bound on Windows. Provider request/completion evidence uses schema-valid request/result JSON files; durable dataset materialization uses `massive_materialization_spec.schema.json` and `materialize_mcp_dataset.py --spec-file`. This prevents PowerShell from reparsing JSON booleans, ISO timestamps, colon-bearing values, endpoint templates such as `{from}`, and lists. Governed Windows execution rejects inline materialization metadata. Repository search must not depend on ripgrep; `search_repo.cmd`/`Select-String` are the baseline Windows path.


## Materialization provenance closure

Every durable materialization must declare `evidence_role` as `RESEARCH_INPUT` or `DIAGNOSTIC`. After acquisition sealing, run `scripts/control_plane/reconcile_materializations.py`; unmanifested/unclassified RESEARCH_INPUT materializations are blocking. DIAGNOSTIC materializations are evidence only and must never enter deterministic pipeline inputs.
