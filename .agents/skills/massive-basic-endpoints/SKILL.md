description: Select and validate Massive REST capabilities documented as Included on the Basic plan in the 2026-09-28 snapshot. Use when a governed Massive MCP task must establish the snapshot entitlement/freshness boundary; do not treat this static catalog as live retrieval or current entitlement proof.
---

**Repository path contract:** paths such as `config/...`, `scripts/...`, `docs/...`, `schemas/...`, `research/...`, and `workflows/...` are relative to the active project root (the directory containing `AGENTS.md` and `.codex/config.toml`), **not** relative to this installed Skill directory. Never walk `..` from the Skill installation to find project files. Never synthesize or reuse an absolute repository path from memory, prior runs, package names, or examples. First inspect the current working directory and verify the two project-root sentinels. If they are absent, do not guess a drive/path; fail project-root resolution explicitly.

# Massive Basic entitlement router

This support skill chooses the narrowest Massive capability represented as **Included on Basic** by the supplied dated snapshot. It is an entitlement/capability guard for `$massive-mcp-data-plane`, not a replacement for Massive MCP.

## Mandatory boundaries

- Treat `references/endpoint-catalog.json` as a **dated 2026-09-28 snapshot**, not permanent proof of current eligibility.
- An endpoint present in the catalog was represented as **Included on Basic** by the supplied source. An endpoint absent from the catalog is **unknown**, not excluded and not permitted.
- Massive MCP endpoint discovery can expose capabilities outside Basic. Discovery alone never upgrades an `UNKNOWN` snapshot status to `INCLUDED`.
- Preserve each row's `basic_limit` semantics. Do not promote end-of-day, daily, periodic, or delayed data to real-time.
- Do not invent parameters, response fields, pagination, authentication, ticker syntax, or undocumented limits. Current parameter/schema verification belongs to Massive MCP.
- Prefer a non-deprecated capability when it satisfies the same need.

## Workflow: Asset → Need → Snapshot limit → MCP verification

1. Identify the market: `stocks`, `options`, `indices`, `forex`, `crypto`, `futures`, or `economy`.
2. Identify the smallest data shape that answers the request.
3. Query the catalog deterministically when practical:

   ```bash
   python .agents/skills/massive-basic-endpoints/scripts/endpoint_lookup.py --market crypto --query "daily market summary"
   ```

   On Windows, if the normal `python.exe` launcher is blocked by the sandbox/runtime, use the no-Python PowerShell fallback:

   ```powershell
   .\.agents\skills\massive-basic-endpoints\scripts\endpoint_lookup.ps1 -Market crypto -Search "daily market summary"
   ```

   This fallback parses only the static catalog; it does not retrieve market data.
4. Compare plausible matches and select the narrowest capability. Read `references/decision-notes.md` only for the relevant special case.
5. Return the exact method/path, snapshot `basic_limit`, and status `INCLUDED` or `UNKNOWN`.
6. For any actual retrieval or current-schema claim, hand off to `$massive-mcp-data-plane`. Do not call the REST API directly.

## Evidence required before completion

A routing result is complete only when it establishes market, capability, exact documented method/path, snapshot `basic_limit`, and whether current MCP verification is still required.

If no catalog entry establishes the requested capability, report the snapshot as **UNKNOWN** rather than inferring plan access.

## Load only when needed

- `references/decision-notes.md` — bar-selection edge cases, market clocks, shared-path caveats, stock filing selection, futures recency, and deprecations.
- `references/provenance.md` — source coverage, transformation policy, and the one repaired description.
- `references/endpoint-catalog.json` — all snapshot entries; prefer the lookup script over loading the full file when one or a few endpoints are needed.
