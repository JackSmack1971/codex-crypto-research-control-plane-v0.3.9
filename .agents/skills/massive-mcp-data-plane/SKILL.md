name: massive-mcp-data-plane
description: Acquire and stage Massive-backed research data through the configured Massive MCP server with Basic-plan entitlement checks, current endpoint verification, pagination, workspace reuse, cutoff discipline, and a sealed acquisition manifest. Use inside governed daily, factor-research, or OOS workflows; do not bypass Massive MCP with direct HTTP/API clients.
---

**Repository path contract:** paths such as `config/...`, `scripts/...`, `docs/...`, `schemas/...`, `research/...`, and `workflows/...` are relative to the active project root (the directory containing `AGENTS.md` and `.codex/config.toml`), **not** relative to this installed Skill directory. Never walk `..` from the Skill installation to find project files. Never synthesize or reuse an absolute repository path from memory, prior runs, package names, or examples. First inspect the current working directory and verify the two project-root sentinels. If they are absent, do not guess a drive/path; fail project-root resolution explicitly.

# Massive MCP data plane

Use this support skill whenever a governed workflow needs Massive source data. Read `docs/massive-mcp-data-plane.md` and `docs/data-capability-boundary.md` before acquisition.

## Required sequence

1. Run the local preflight before market acquisition. Confirm the deterministic pipeline/materializer/validators and request gate exist and can execute. Create a unique attempt ID; never overwrite a previous attempt. Initialize one request ledger from `config/massive-request-policy.json` before the first provider-facing `call_api`.
2. Read `config/daily-capabilities.json`. For every applicable capability, keep endpoint discovery, dated Basic-snapshot status, and actual authenticated access as separate evidence. Use bounded authenticated probes before large acquisitions.
3. Apply severity exactly: CORE denial/unresolved access blocks; ENRICHMENT denial degrades; EVENT_OPTIONAL denial/absence is recorded without blocking unless the active registered design explicitly requires it.
4. Use Massive MCP `search_endpoints` for current route/parameter verification and `call_api` for actual retrieval. On Windows, invoke request-gate/materialization Python scripts through the attempt-bound `scripts/control_plane/run_python.cmd` with `-RuntimeFile <runtime.json>` resolved by native bootstrap; never rely on a bare `python` shim after bootstrap. Before **every** `call_api`, obtain a permit from `scripts/control_plane/massive_request_gate.py`; complete that ledger entry immediately after the tool returns. The gate serializes provider starts and enforces the rolling cap. `search_endpoints`, `workspace`, and `query_data` are MCP control/local operations and are outside this provider-call budget. Do not treat endpoint discovery as entitlement proof. Follow pagination completely; every provider page retrieved through `call_api`, including a `next_url` follow-up, requires its own permit/completion ledger entry.
5. Prefer one Massive workspace for staging. Staged tables are transient and **must not** be treated as durable run evidence.
6. Materialize every used dataset with `scripts/control_plane/materialize_mcp_dataset.py --spec-file <path>`. Persist one schema-valid `schemas/massive_materialization_spec.schema.json` file per dataset so chunks, endpoint template, params, timestamps, expected rows, and key/sort fields do not cross the Windows shell boundary inline: inspect staged row count/schema, export stable ordered 100-200 row `query_data` slices, reject truncation, verify unique keys and exact local/staged row-count agreement, and persist canonical immutable JSONL + SHA-256 sidecar metadata.
7. For custom-bar history fetched per ticker, make the deterministic `query_data` projection add the literal ticker as a `ticker` column before combining chunks.
8. The request ledger is the canonical client-side provider-call receipt. Record endpoint/parameter digest, permit time, completion time, warning/outcome, returned row count, provider request ID when exposed, and pagination terminal/next-link state. Never invent request IDs. A `RATE_LIMIT` warning immediately marks the attempt TAINTED; stop acquisition and require a new attempt rather than retrying within the tainted one. If the user tightens the provider-rate constraint after an attempt has begun, stop the attempt and initialize a fresh ledger under the tighter policy rather than retroactively changing the old policy snapshot.
9. Check all as-of timestamps against the research cutoff. Post-cutoff data may verify schema/provenance but cannot enter the fixed run.
10. Seal the acquisition only after materialization. COMPLETE/DEGRADED require every CORE dataset to have successful authenticated access, complete pagination, verified local materialization, matching row count, and digest. PARTIAL is in-progress and not downstream-eligible. Before methodology audit/freeze, run `massive_request_gate.py audit --seal`; only a sealed PASS ledger is eligible for forecast freeze.

## Completion boundary

The source plane is complete when the capability evaluation exists, every CORE dataset is durably materialized and verified, the acquisition is sealed COMPLETE or DEGRADED, the provider-call ledger seals PASS, and any missing enrichment is explicit. Never bypass Massive MCP with direct HTTP/API clients, SDKs, copied API keys, web search, or another provider.

## Windows command transport

On Windows, never put provider parameter JSON, warning text, response metadata, materialization timestamps, endpoint templates, or other structured metadata directly on the command line. Request gate operations use `--request-file` / `--result-file`; durable materialization uses `--spec-file`. Persist a schema-valid request spec and completion result, then invoke `massive_request_gate.py permit --request-file <path>` and `complete --result-file <path>` through `scripts\control_plane\run_python.cmd`. Never invoke `run_python.ps1` directly for governed workflow stages. Treat `rg` as optional; use `scripts\control_plane\search_repo.cmd` or native PowerShell `Select-String` when it is absent.


## Materialization provenance closure

Every durable materialization must declare `evidence_role` as `RESEARCH_INPUT` or `DIAGNOSTIC`. After acquisition sealing, run `scripts/control_plane/reconcile_materializations.py`; unmanifested/unclassified RESEARCH_INPUT materializations are blocking. DIAGNOSTIC materializations are evidence only and must never enter deterministic pipeline inputs.


**Half-open UTC-day contract:** `research_cutoff` is an exclusive boundary at the start of the next UTC day. An observation belongs to the research day iff its effective timestamp is strictly `< research_cutoff`. Thus `2026-09-28T23:59:59.999Z` is valid for the 2026-09-28 run, while `2026-09-29T00:00:00Z` is not. Never require an EOD provider bar to end exactly at the cutoff.
