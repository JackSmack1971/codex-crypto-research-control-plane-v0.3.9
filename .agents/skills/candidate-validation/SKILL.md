description: Independently validate an already-researched signal candidate before any promotion decision. Use when validation evidence is requested for a candidate; do not use for initial factor research or the final methodology audit.

**Repository path contract:** paths such as `config/...`, `scripts/...`, `docs/...`, `schemas/...`, `research/...`, and `workflows/...` are relative to the active project root (the directory containing `AGENTS.md` and `.codex/config.toml`), **not** relative to this installed Skill directory. Never walk `..` from the Skill installation to find project files. Never synthesize or reuse an absolute repository path from memory, prior runs, package names, or examples. First inspect the current working directory and verify the two project-root sentinels. If they are absent, do not guess a drive/path; fail project-root resolution explicitly.

# Candidate validation

Own the independent statistical-validation stage. A `PROMOTE` verdict means only "eligible for `$candidate-promotion`"; it is not a state transition and does not authorize discretionary inclusion in the investable signal set.

## Inputs

Require a preregistered hypothesis plus candidate research artifacts. Read `docs/research-state-model.md`, `docs/data-capability-boundary.md`, `docs/massive-mcp-data-plane.md`, and `schemas/validation_report.schema.json` when validating the candidate.

## Workflow

1. Bind the candidate to exactly one registered hypothesis. A missing registration or identity mismatch is `INVALID_EXPERIMENT`.
2. Delegate validation to a fresh `statistical-validator` context. If independent context cannot be obtained, return `INCONCLUSIVE`; do not reuse the factor-research context as the validator.
3. Verify chronology, leakage, multiple-testing correction, uncertainty, parameter stability, regime dependence, turnover, pessimistic cost scenarios, OOS evidence, and (for Massive-backed inputs) the sealed acquisition identity/cutoff used by the candidate. Missing acquisition provenance is material missing evidence. Missing material evidence is `INCONCLUSIVE`; an invalid temporal or leakage design is `INVALID_EXPERIMENT`; a valid candidate that fails the registered criteria is `REJECT`.
4. Persist a validation artifact under `research/validations/` matching the schema. Do not create or modify promotion state.

## Completion

Complete only when the validation artifact is schema-compatible, its candidate/hypothesis identities agree with the inspected inputs, its evidence paths are inspectable, and the verdict is exactly `PROMOTE`, `REJECT`, `INCONCLUSIVE`, or `INVALID_EXPERIMENT`.
